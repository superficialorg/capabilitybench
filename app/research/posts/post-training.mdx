Superficial Labs — AI Research & Product

Superficial Labs is an artificial intelligence research and product company. Our mission is to accelerate human progress by compounding AI capability and reliability in the world's most critical applications.

We're building systems that bring structure to the surface of large models, make behaviour verifiable, and unlock AI deployment in high-impact domains like science, medicine, engineering, and decision-making.

Our team includes researchers, engineers, and builders who have worked across large-scale training systems, production ML infrastructure, safety tooling, and widely deployed AI applications. We work at the intersection of deep research and practical engineering, and we're looking for collaborators who want to help define the next frontier of post-training.

About the Role

Post-training sits at the centre of our roadmap. It is the bridge between raw model capability and systems that are reliable enough for consequential use. Your work will determine how models extract structure, satisfy requirements, respond to policies, and achieve compounding improvements across generations.

This role blends fundamental research with hands-on engineering — we don't separate the two. You'll design experiments, write high-performance code, read and produce technical papers, and help shape the foundations of how AI learns to be both powerful and dependable.

This is an evergreen research role. We review applications continuously and reach out when opportunities align with your experience and interests. If you build experience over time, you're welcome to reapply every 6 months.

What You'll Do

• Develop the post-training recipe

Iterate on datasets, training stages, hyperparameters, optimisation procedures, verification signals, and policy-driven objectives. Measure how they affect capability, reliability, and compounding behaviour across models.

• Design and evolve evaluations

Define evals that truly capture what matters. Refine them as systems improve. Create quantitative measures that detect reasoning failures, structural gaps, verification weaknesses, and emergent behaviour.

• Debug, analyse, and understand

Investigate unexpected behaviours in training runs, pipelines, policies, and structure-extraction layers. Develop conceptual explanations that guide the next iteration.

• Scale and explore new methodologies

Scale existing methods and invent new ones. Study how performance metrics scale with dataset size and policy complexity. Explore entirely new training signals, verification loops, or structure formats.

• Advance the field

Publish research, release tools, share insights, and contribute to the wider community working on capability, reliability, post-training, and structural AI systems.

Skills and Qualifications

Minimum Qualifications

• Strong proficiency in Python and familiarity with deep learning frameworks (PyTorch preferred; JAX or TensorFlow also welcome).

• Experience writing scalable code and debugging distributed training pipelines.

• Degree (or equivalent experience) in Computer Science, Machine Learning, Mathematics, Physics, or a related field with strong theoretical grounding.

• Clear written and verbal communication — ability to articulate complex ideas clearly.

Preferred Qualifications

(We encourage you to apply even if you only meet some of these.)

• Strong understanding of probability, statistics, and ML fundamentals.

• Experience with post-training methods: RLHF, RLAIF, preference modelling, reward learning, alignment, or structured supervision.

• Experience designing or analysing human data collection or annotation workflows.

• Contributions to alignment research, data-centric AI, evals, reliability tooling, or structured reasoning systems.

• PhD or equivalent research/industry experience with both theoretical and empirical depth.
