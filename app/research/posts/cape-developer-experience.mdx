Research Engineer — CAPE Developer Experience (Remote)

Superficial Labs — AI Research & Product

Superficial Labs is an artificial intelligence research and product company. Our goal is to accelerate human progress by compounding AI capability and reliability in the world's most critical applications.

We build systems that surface structure from model outputs, enforce requirements explicitly, and make advanced AI deployable in high-impact domains. CAPE — our policy-driven post-training framework — is a core part of this vision.

To make CAPE accessible to researchers, developers, and enterprises, we're growing our developer experience and applied-research capabilities.

About CAPE

CAPE (Capability Achievement via Policy Enforcement) is Superficial's post-training system that teaches models to satisfy executable policies over structured representations of their outputs — rather than approximating human preferences.

CAPE enables:

• precision-controlled post-training

• verifiable behaviour

• transferable policies that compound across model generations

• domain experts (not just ML engineers) to shape model behaviour directly

We're building CAPE to be usable, extensible, and developer-friendly — a framework that researchers, engineers, and enterprises can build with, integrate, and customize.

This role is central to that effort.

About the Role

We're hiring a Research Engineer focused on Developer Experience to help shape, refine, and expand how developers interact with CAPE.

You'll work hands-on with real users — from independent researchers to enterprise ML teams — helping them build with CAPE while using their feedback to improve the system. You'll write examples, build integrations, craft policy templates, extend the CAPE library, identify friction points, and contribute to roadmap decisions.

This role sits at the intersection of:

• research (understanding CAPE's behaviour, structure extraction, verification signals)

• engineering (building tools, APIs, examples, and libraries)

• developer experience (ensuring CAPE is intuitive, powerful, and enjoyable to use)

• product insight (surfacing patterns from users to guide the evolution of CAPE)

It's ideal for someone who loves writing high-quality code, exploring new workflows, engaging with users, and making advanced AI tooling accessible without sacrificing rigour.

CAPE unlocks ambitious applications — your job is to help users reach them.

What You'll Do

• Build and maintain the CAPE Cookbook

Create examples, recipes, policy templates, structured-reasoning demos, and documentation that help users get productive quickly.

• Work directly with developers and researchers

Debug issues, profile bottlenecks, and help users design pipelines that combine structure extraction, verification, and policy enforcement.

• Improve CAPE's ergonomics

Identify friction points in the API, structure-extraction interfaces, policy authoring, or verification workflows — then work with research + infra teams to solve them.

• Build integrations and tooling

Prototype extensions to inference servers, eval suites, logging tools, and LLM frameworks that make CAPE easier to adopt in production or research settings.

• Share insights with the community

Publish walkthroughs, blog posts, guides, and talks that demonstrate what CAPE can do and how to use it effectively.

• Shape CAPE's roadmap

Surface recurring patterns from real users and help define both near-term improvements and long-term product direction.

⸻

Preferred Qualifications

Experience can come from many paths. You might be a great fit if you:

• Have experience fine-tuning or post-training large models (SFT, RLHF, RLAIF, policy-based systems, or custom training pipelines).

• Have contributed to software libraries, especially open-source projects.

• Care deeply about developer experience — onboarding flow, docs, sharp edges, ergonomics, and clarity.

• Enjoy engaging with technical communities: writing examples, answering questions, sharing learnings.

• Are comfortable reasoning about post-training, structure extraction, policy enforcement, evals, and model behaviour.

• Can articulate tradeoffs between different training and control methods (pre-training signals vs post-training objectives vs verification).

• Have written tutorials, examples, or internal docs that helped others understand ML systems.

Logistics

Location: Remote — we are a fully distributed team.

Compensation: Competitive salary + meaningful equity.

Visa: We provide visa support for the right candidates.

Benefits: Comprehensive health coverage, flexible PTO, parental leave, equipment support, and budget for research / learning / conference travel.
