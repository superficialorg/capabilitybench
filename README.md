# CapabilityBench

A public registry that replaces opaque intelligence scores with traceable capability verdicts.

## About

CapabilityBench evaluates AI models against executable specifications like regulatory compliance (HIPAA, GDPR), financial suitability rules, clinical protocol adherence, and multi-step workflow execution. Instead of aggregate scores, you see exactly what each model can and can't do.

## Development

pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Deploy
